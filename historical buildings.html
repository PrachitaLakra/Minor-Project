            <h2><strong>1. Taj Mahal</strong></h2>
          <p>Located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh, The Taj Mahal was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD.<br>  The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. </p>

          <h2> <strong>2. India Gate</strong></h2>
          <p>At the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an "Arc-de-Triomphe" like archway in the middle of a crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the World War I. The memorial bears the names of more than 13,516 British and Indian soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919.<br>The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin. Another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti was added much later, after India got its independence. The eternal flame burns day and night under the arch to remind the nation of soldiers who laid down their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971.</p>

          <h2><strong>3. Khajurao Temples </strong></h2>
          <p>The temples at Khajuraho were built during the Chandella dynasty, which reached its apogee between 950 and 1050. Only about 20 temples remain; they fall into three distinct groups and belong to two different religions – Hinduism and Jainism. They strike a perfect balance between architecture and sculpture. The Temple of Kandariya is decorated with a profusion of sculptures that are among the greatest masterpieces of Indian art.</p>

          <h2> <strong>4. Red Fort</strong></h2>
          <p>The Red Fort is a historical fortification in the old Delhi area. Shah Jahan constructed it in the year 1639 as a result of a capital shift from Agra to Delhi. Used as the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal dynasty, this imposing piece of architecture derives its name from its impregnable red sandstone walls.<br> <br>Today, this monument is home to several museums that have an assortment of precious artefacts on display. Every year, the Indian Prime Minister unfurls the national flag here on the Independence Day.</p>

          <h2><strong>5. Victoria Memorial Hall </strong></h2>
          <p>The Victoria Memorial, one of the top historical places in Kolkata, is the brainchild of Lord Curzon, a Viceroy of India. When Queen Victoria, who was the Empress of British India, died in January 1901, Curzon suggested building a grand memorial to honor her. He proposed the memorial to be a stately edifice with a museum where visitors get a glimpse of the marvels of the past. <br>The foundation for the memorial was laid on 4 January 1906 by the Prince of Wales, who later became King George V.</p>

          <h2> <strong>6. Elephanta Caves</strong></h2>
          <p>The Elephanta Caves are located in Western India on Elephanta Island (otherwise known as the Island of Gharapuri), which features two hillocks separated by a narrow valley. The small island is dotted with numerous ancient archaeological remains that are the sole testimonies to its rich cultural past. These archaeological remains reveal evidence of occupation from as early as the 2nd century BC.<br>The rock-cut Elephanta Caves were constructed about the mid-5th to 6th centuries AD. The most important among the caves is the great Cave 1, which measures 39 metres from the front entrance to the back. In plan, this cave in the western hill closely resembles Dumar Lena cave at Ellora, in India. </p>

          <h2><strong>7. Qutub Minar </strong></h2>
          <p>Built in the early 13th century a few kilometres south of Delhi, the red sandstone tower of Qutb Minar is 72.5 m high, tapering from 2.75 m in diameter at its peak to 14.32 m at its base, and alternating angular and rounded flutings. The surrounding archaeological area contains funerary buildings, notably the magnificent Alai-Darwaza Gate, the masterpiece of Indo-Muslim art (built in 1311), and two mosques, including the Quwwatu'l-Islam, the oldest in northern India, built of materials reused from some 20 Brahman temples. <br>Drawing references from their Ghurid homeland, they constructed a minar (minaret) at the south-eastern corner of the Quwwatu’l-Islam between 1199 and 1503, thereby completing the vocabulary of a typical classic Islamic mosque. </p>

          <h2> <strong>8.Hawa Mahal</strong></h2>
          <p>The massive edifice of Hawa Mahal stands at the intersection of the main road in Jaipur, Badi Chaupad and was built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh in the year 1799. Hawa Mahal derives its name from its unique structure, which is a mesh of small windows that allowed cool wind to enter the palace and hence kept the palace comfortable during the hot summer months. The main reason behind the palace's construction was to allow the women of the royal house to observe the festivities on the streets whilst being unseen from the outside as was the custom of the land.<br>Hawa Mahal is a structure made of red and pink sandstone and has a pyramidal structure which almost resembles a crown. </p>

          <p>The Mahabodhi Temple Complex is one of the four holy sites related to the life of the Lord Buddha, and particularly to the attainment of Enlightenment.

It is one of the earliest Buddhist temples built entirely in brick, still standing in India, from the late Gupta period. <br> The site contains a descendant of the Bodhi Tree under which Buddha gained enlightenment, and has been a major pilgrimage destination of Buddhists for well over two thousand years, and some elements date to the period of Ashoka (died c. 232 BCE).</p>
